# tiger-ca Python Clean Architecture Template

This cookiecutter template was adapted from, and named for, [@t-tiger](https://github.com/t-tiger)'s amazing [clean architecture example](https://github.com/t-tiger/Python-CleanArchitecture-Example). Of the many examples available on the web, I prefer his layout. Some changes have been made in favor of [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) for web framwork and [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) for dependency management.

# Usage

```
cookiecutter git+https://github.com/antigenius/tiger-ca
